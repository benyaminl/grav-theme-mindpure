# Mind Pure
A Free themes built on the top of Grav CMS for a personal website, simple, sleek, and fast using [Pure CSS](https://github.com/yahoo/pure/) griding, (*rather than BS because BS is too big) from Yahoo. The Pure Griding included with the template.
This template is still in alpha state, you still can't use it, so be patient ok!
